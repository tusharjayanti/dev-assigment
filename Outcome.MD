What you're doing well:
- Good use of third party libraries like react-trend.
Where you could improve:
- Could have written better app documentation, what it does, what's used etc
- Code architecture should have been improved to have an organized style to ensure maintainability
- Code could have been linted properly - tip: setting up eslint/prettier is always useful.
- Adding tests for ensure components work as expected.
